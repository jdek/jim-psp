    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>This  tutorial  is  intended  for  people who  have  already  a
    knowledge of Python.  If you're new  to Python, take a look at the
    excellent   <a   href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">Python
    tutorial</a>.     I    have   found    that    reading   the    <a
    href="http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html">Library    reference</a>
    in full  is an enlightening  experiment (don't try to  remember it
    all! But  after reading it you'll  find you know  exactly where to
    look for  when a problem arises). Another  interesting document to
    read  once you've grasped  the basics  of the  language is  the <a
    href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html">PEP         08</a>,
    containing useful style guides.</p>

    <p>This tutorial will try to  step through all the classes exposed
    by  the  psp2d  module,  but  will obviously  not  cover  them  in
    depth.    For     a    complete    reference,     see    the    <a
    href="psp2d.html">module reference</a>.</p>

    <h1>Hello world</h1>

    <p>As the  tradition goes, we'll start by  printing 'Hello, world'
    to   the    screen.    Make    sure   you   have    correctly   <a
    href="install.html">installed</a> Python on your PSP, and save the
    following code  to the file  'script.py' in the same  directory as
    EBOOT.PBP. You  will also need to put  the <a href="font.png">font
    file</a> in this directory.</p>

<pre>
#-*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

import psp2d

def main():
    scr = psp2d.Screen()
    fnt = psp2d.Font('font.png')
    img = psp2d.Image(480, 272)
    img.clear(psp2d.Color(0, 0, 0))
    fnt.drawText(img, 0, 0, 'Hello, world')
    scr.blit(img)
    scr.swap()
    while True:
        pad = psp2d.Controller()
        if pad.circle:
            break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except:
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc(file = file('trace.txt', 'w'))
</pre>

    <center><img src="shot01.png" /></center>

    <p>You  can  exit the  program  by  pressing  Circle. Let's  first
    evacuate the try/except  construct; this is only here  to dump the
    call  stack if an  exception occurs.  Useful for  debugging. Let's
    walk through the main function.</p>

<pre>
    scr = psp2d.Screen()
</pre>

    <p>The    <a    href="psp2d.html#klass_Screen">Screen</a>    class
    represents  the physical  screen of  the  PSP, you'll  need it  to
    display anything.  Note that you  must NOT instantiate  this class
    more than  once (this will  be automatically enforced in  a future
    version). With  a few differences,  the Screen class has  the same
    methods  as the <a  href="psp2d.html#klass_Image">Image</a> class,
    so you can use it almost like you would use any other image.</p>

<pre>
    fnt = psp2d.Font('font.png')
</pre>

    <p>This  instantiates  a <a  href="psp2d.html#klass_Font">Font</a>
    object, which is  needed whenever you want to  draw text. There is
    no       built-in      font;       you       need      an       <a
    href="http://www.linux-games.com/sfont/">SFont</a>-like         PNG
    file.</p>

<pre>
    img = psp2d.Image(480, 272)
</pre>

    <p>Here, we  create an image with  the same dimensions  as the PSP
    screen.   We'll use  this  image  to draw  the  text.  In  earlier
    versions, you  could only draw  text to an  image, and not  to the
    screen.   I kept  the old  version of  the script  for educational
    purposes;  nowadays  you should  directly  draw  the  text to  the
    screen. It's <b>way</b> faster.</p>

<pre>
    img.clear(psp2d.Color(0, 0, 0))
</pre>

    <p>We clear the image using  a black color.  Colors are abstracted
    through  the   <a  href="psp2d.html#klass_Color">Color</a>  class,
    which is  instantiated with three integer arguments  between 0 and
    255: red, green and blue  values. There is also a fourth, optional
    argument that specifies the  level of transparency; it defaults to
    0 (opaque).</p>

<pre>
    fnt.drawText(img, 0, 0, 'Hello, world')
</pre>

    <p>Actually draws the text at coordinates (0, 0) in the image. You
    can  pass a <a  href="psp2d.html#klass_Screen">Screen</a> instance
    as first argument also.</p>

<pre>
    scr.blit(img)
</pre>

    <p>This is the  simplest use of the 'blit'  method. This method is
    common to Screen and Image  objects; it copies the argument to the
    instance. The complete signature  is <i>obj1.blit(obj2, sx, sy, w,
    h,  dx,  dy,  blend)</i>;  All  arguments  except  the  first  are
    optionnal;  the effect  is to  copy the  rectangle (sx,  sy, sx+w,
    sy+h)  from obj2  to obj1  at coordinates  (dx, dy).   The 'blend'
    argument is a Boolean which defaults  to False. If it is True, the
    transparency  level of  the  source object  (obj2)  is taken  into
    account when blitting.</p>

<pre>
    scr.swap()
</pre>

    <p>Drawing to  the screen uses  double buffering. That  means that
    instead of  having one buffer  to represent the screen,  there are
    two,  the  display  buffer  and  the  draw  buffer.   All  drawing
    operations are directed to the  draw buffer, which is not actually
    displayed. The 'swap'  method of the Screen object  swaps the draw
    buffer  and the display  buffer, so  that what  we just  drawed is
    actually displayed.  This is necessary to avoid  flicker; to learn
    more      about     double      buffering,     see      the     <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Buffering">article</a>
    on Wikipedia.</p>

<pre>
    while True:
        pad = psp2d.Controller()
        if pad.circle:
            break
</pre>

    <p>This  loops  until  the   Circle  button  is  pressed.  The  <a
    href="psp2d.html#klass_Controller">Controller</a>  class reads the
    state of the pad upon instantiation and makes it available through
    read-only properties.</p>

    <h1>Dancing hello world</h1>

    <p>Now we'll try  to add some animation to  that, and a background
    image.  Copy  the  following  image  to your  memory  stick  (same
    directory as font.png):</p>

    <center><img src="background.png" /></center>

    <p>We'll center  the 'hello, world'  message and make  each letter
    move vertically on a sinusoid. Here, we must take into account the
    fact that SFonts are variable-width.</p>

<pre>
#-*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

import psp2d, math

def main(msg):
    screen = psp2d.Screen()
    bgimg = psp2d.Image('background.png')
    font = psp2d.Font('font.png')

    widths = []
    totalw = 0
    for c in msg:
        widths.append(font.textWidth(c))
        totalw += font.textWidth(c)

    y = (272 - font.textHeight(msg)) / 2
    x = (480 - totalw) / 2

    angle = 0.0

    while True:
        img = psp2d.Image(bgimg)
        dx = 0
        for idx, c in enumerate(msg):
            font.drawText(img, x + dx, y + 20 * math.sin(angle + 0.2 * idx), c)
            dx += widths[idx]

        screen.blit(img)
        screen.swap()
        angle += 0.2

        pad = psp2d.Controller()
        if pad.circle:
            break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main('Hello, world!')
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    except:
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc(file = file('trace.txt', 'w'))
</pre>

    <center><img src="shot02.png" /></center>

    <p>I won't  spend time on  the 'algorithmic' side, let's  just see
    what's new here.</p>

<pre>
    bgimg = psp2d.Image('background.png')
</pre>

    <p>Instead of  creating an empty image,  you can of  course load a
    file. Only  PNG files are  supported. The dimensions of  the image
    are  accessible  through  the  read-only  properties  'width'  and
    'height'.</p>

<pre>
        widths.append(font.textWidth(c))
</pre>

    <p>As SFonts  are variable-width, you need to  take each character
    into                account.                 The                <a
    href="psp2d.html#method_Font_textWidth">Font.textWidth</a>   method
    returns the  width, in pixels,  necessary to render  the specified
    text         with        this         font.          The        <a
    href="psp2d.html#method_Font_textHeight">Font.textHeight</a>
    method does the  same for the height, but  actually always returns
    the  same value for  a given  font. you  still need  to pass  it a
    string though.</p>

<pre>
        img = psp2d.Image(bgimg)
</pre>

    <p>This is the third and last  way to create an image; if you pass
    another image to the constructor, it will copy it.</p>

    <h1>Optimizing</h1>

    <p>Since 2005-11-12, a new underlying implementation allows one to
    draw text  directly to  the screen. Let's  modify the  script (red
    lines were removed, green lines were added):</p>

<pre>
#-*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

import psp2d, math

def main(msg):
    screen = psp2d.Screen()
    bgimg = psp2d.Image('background.png')
    font = psp2d.Font('font.png')

    widths = []
    totalw = 0
    for c in msg:
        widths.append(font.textWidth(c))
        totalw += font.textWidth(c)

    y = (272 - font.textHeight(msg)) / 2
    x = (480 - totalw) / 2

    angle = 0.0

    while True:
        <font color="red"># img = psp2d.Image(bgimg)</font>
	<font color="green">screen.blit(bgimg)</font>
        dx = 0
        for idx, c in enumerate(msg):
            <font color="red"># font.drawText(img, x + dx, y + 20 * math.sin(angle + 0.2 * idx), c)</font>
            <font color="green">font.drawText(screen, x + dx, y + 20 * math.sin(angle + 0.2 * idx), c)</font>
            dx += widths[idx]

        <font color="red"># screen.blit(img)</font>
        screen.swap()
        angle += 0.2

        pad = psp2d.Controller()
        if pad.circle:
            break

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main('Hello, world!')
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    except:
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc(file = file('trace.txt', 'w'))
</pre>

    <p>Try both the  old and the new version, and  you'll see why it's
    better to blit()  or drawText() directly to the  screen instead of
    using an intermediate buffer.</p>

    <h1>Adding music</h1>

    <p>We'll     use     the     music     distributed     with     <a
    href="http://www.1homebrew.com/psp/snake.shtml">Snake</a>,
    stranglehold.xm. Change the import line to</p>

<pre>
import psp2d, pspsnd, math
</pre>

    <p>And  add  the  following  code  at  the  start  of  the  main()
    function:</p>

<pre>
    pspsnd.setMusicVolume(128)
    music = pspsnd.Music('stranglehold.xm')
    music.start()
</pre>

    <p>Don't forget to copy stranglehold.xm  to the PSP. Done! See the
    pspsnd <a href="pspsnd.html">module reference</a> for details.</p>

    <hr />

    <h1>Changelog</h1>

    <ul>

      <li>2005-12-12: added music</li>

      <li>2005-12-11:  you can now  draw text  directly to  the screen
      (and it's  <b>way</b> faster). drawText  is now a method  of the
      Font class.</li>

    </ul>
